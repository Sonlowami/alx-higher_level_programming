# OXOF. Object Relational Mapping

An Object Relational Mapper is a program that provides an interface to access
database entries as objects in object-oriented languages. 
In particulat, a special type of class called 'a model' maps objects to a table
in the database.

## What this project is all about

This project exercises SQLAlchemy, an ORM for Python. In the first tasks, we solve everything
by writing SQL Querries using python's MySQLdb interface. Then from task 7, exercises focus on
creating, updating, deleting and reading data from databases using the SQLAlchemy ORM interface.
