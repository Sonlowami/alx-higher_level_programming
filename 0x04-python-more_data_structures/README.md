# 0x04. Python - More Data Structures: Sets and Dictionaries

Sets are data types in python that contain only unique elements in an arbitrary order.
On the other hand, dictionaries can be considered an associative data type, which means
they are made up of key-value pairs.
Dictionary keys are immutable objects such as strings, number literals or a tuple of
immutable objects only.
Sets and lists can be used to do different things. This directory contain solutions to
some of the simple programming challenges that can be solved using either of these data
structures in Python.
