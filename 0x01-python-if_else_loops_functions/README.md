# 0X01. Python - if/else, loops, functions

As any other programming language, python have features that give the programmer the ability to
control the flow of execution of the program.
In python, these are the if-elif-else blocks, for and while loops, match statements, and functions.

This project contain programs that uses any of these features to solve programming languages. Like
everything in this repository, they are part of the ALX-Software Engineering education program.
