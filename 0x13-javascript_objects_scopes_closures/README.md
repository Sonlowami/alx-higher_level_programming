# 0x13. JavaScript - Objects, Scopes and Closures

This is a continuation of a 2-day introduction to JavaScript. Solutions to part I challenges can be found at [my github](https://github.com/Sonlowami/alx-higher_level_programming/tree/master/0x12-javascript-warm_up).

The focus of this project is on JavaScript objects. The first 8 tasks explore the concept of classes, objects and inheritance, by building two classes: Rectangle and Square.

The other tasks explore other topics like the concept of Closures.
